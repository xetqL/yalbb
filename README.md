# Introduction
Yet Another Load Balancing Benchmark is a C++17 API designed to benchmarking MPI load balancing solutions against 3D n-body problem with short-range force. YALBB is indeed just another benchmark but the core idea is to let the scientist focusing on what matters to him: load balancing.

# Requirements
- g++-8 (C++17)
- MPI-1.x/MPI-2.x

# Installation
```console
git clone https://github.com/xetqL/yalbb.git
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/folder/for/lib_and_headers .
make && make install
```

# Example
